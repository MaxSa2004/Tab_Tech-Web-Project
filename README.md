# Tab_Tech-Web-Project
Here’s a clean, engaging structure you can use for your README, with topic ideas and what to include under each. It’s tailored to your Tâb game’s features (AI, dice overlay, i18n PT/EN, accessibility, stats, leaderboard, etc.).

Title and tagline
- Project name + one-sentence pitch (traditional board game, modern UI, AI opponent, bilingual)
- A compact badges row (Live Demo, License, Languages: PT/EN, Accessibility, Tech stack)

Hero section
- Short looping GIF or screenshot of gameplay (board + dice overlay)
- “Play now” link (if hosted) and “Quick start” (local run in a browser)

Table of contents
- Auto-generated or manual list of sections

Quick start (for players)
- How to play locally (double-click index.html)
- Live demo link (if any)
- Supported browsers and screen sizes
- Minimal controls: Throw dice, Move piece, Skip turn, Start/Leave Game

Features at a glance
- Modes: vs Player / vs AI (Easy, Normal, Hard)
- Board configuration (7–15 columns, odd)
- First to Play toggle
- Stick-dice overlay (0→6 mapping, extra throws)
- Bilingual (PT/EN) with on-the-fly switch
- Accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard focus, modal behavior)
- Chat-like prompts + game summary with stats
- Leaderboard (sort/search, win ratio calc)
- Sound toggle (if applicable)

Gameplay overview
- Very short bullet rules (move, convert on 1, capture, end condition)
- Dice rules and probabilities
- Turn flow (throw → move → extra or pass)
- Captured pieces panel behavior (which side shows “your pieces” depending on P1/P2)

AI overview
- Algorithm: Expectiminimax with alpha-beta (brief)
- Difficulty levels and what changes (depth, randomness on Normal)
- Evaluation ideas (piece count, progress, safety lanes)
- Limitations/performance notes

Internationalization (i18n)
- Languages available: PT, EN
- What’s translated (UI, modals, messages, dice overlay, summary)
- How to add a new language (add keys, update setLang hooks)
- Notes on placeholders and option IDs (e.g., easy/normal/hard)

Accessibility
- ARIA roles, labels, focus management in modals
- Keyboard behavior (Escape to close, initial focus)
- Screen reader considerations
- Reduced motion (if applicable)

Game summary and stats
- What’s tracked: duration, winner, turns, moves, captures, passes, extra rolls, dice distribution, who started
- Where it appears (end modal), screenshots/GIF
- How “First to Play” and difficulty are displayed (translated)

Leaderboard
- What’s shown (rank, user, games played/won, win ratio)
- Interactions: search (highlight), sort (ascending/descending)
- Data source (static/demo), how to plug a backend later

Configuration and UI elements
- Board width, mode, AI level, first to play
- Buttons and their states during gameplay (Start, Throw dice, Skip turn, Leave)
- Language switch (PT/EN)

Architecture
- High-level diagram or bullet flow (UI -> Game state -> Dice overlay -> AI -> DOM updates)
- Core modules and roles:
  - scripts/gameScript.js (game loop, board, turns, moves, capture)
  - scripts/ai.js (decision engine)
  - scripts/statsScript.js (tracking + summary modal)
  - scripts/languageScript.js (i18n + live updates)
  - scripts/visualScript.js (modals UX)
  - scripts/leaderBoard.js (sorting/search)
- Board model: rows 0–3, columns dynamic, arrows for paths
- Piece state machine: not-moved → moved → row-four

Project structure
- Short tree with folders and what each contains (images, styles, scripts)
- Fonts used (Montserrat, Inter)

Design notes
- Visual choices (colors for red/yellow, glow highlights)
- Dice overlay design (sticks, up/down faces, countdown)
- Mobile responsiveness decisions

Troubleshooting / FAQs
- Start Game disabled (select mode and difficulty for AI)
- “First to Play” expectations (P1 vs P2, titles for captured panels swap based on human player)
- Language didn’t update something (cache/refresh, option IDs)
- Dice overlay stuck or duplicated (close timers/overlay handling)
- Modal not closing with Esc (focus or listener details)

Roadmap
- Ideas: persistent leaderboard, online multiplayer, animations, undo, hints, mobile gestures, PWA, theme toggle

Contributing
- How to propose translations (add i18n keys)
- Coding style guidelines (naming for ids/keys)
- Issue reporting template ideas

Testing / QA checklist
- Language switch end-to-end (UI, dice, summary, leaderboard)
- AI difficulty sanity checks
- Edge board widths (7, 15)
- Extra roll rules (1/4/6)
- Captures and captured panels labeling for P1/P2
- Accessibility checks (tab order, modal focus trap)

Performance
- Notes on AI depth and DOM operations
- Tips (reduce animations, limit depth on mobile)

Security/privacy
- LocalStorage only (language preference)
- No external data collection

License
- Choose and link (MIT, etc.)

Acknowledgments
- Historical sources for Tâb (brief)
- Libraries (if any) and inspirations

Changelog (optional)
- Link to notable fixes (i18n, “First to Play”, difficulty translation, leaderboard labels)

Screenshots & media
- Suggested images: board states, capture, dice overlay, summary, leaderboard
- Short captions

Badges (optional enhancements)
- Localization (PT/EN)
- “Built with” (JS/HTML/CSS)
- Accessibility friendly
- Live demo

Tips for an aesthetic README
- Use concise sections with icons/emojis sparingly
- Place GIF near top; keep TOC short
- Use comparison tables for features/difficulties
- Collapsible details for long rules
- Keep consistent heading levels and spacing

If you want, I can convert this outline into a README scaffold later (still without writing your content), or create a minimal and a full version so you can pick one.
